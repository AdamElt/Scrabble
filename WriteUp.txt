The scrabble assignment was tough from the start but I managed to finish it with all features
working as they should. The board has a drag and drop element with different score multipliers and buttons
to reset the board and their scores. The dictionaryCheck() function loads the dictionary and validates the words 
created by the player. The addLetter() function allows players to be able to drag and drop the letter 
tiles on the board and checks if the palcement is valid. Finally, the reset() button resets the game entirely along 
with the board, scores, and tiles in the players hand.
